#### 1/13/2022 How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop
In CATSUP this week we discussed the article [How scientists fool themselves – and how they can stop](https://www.nature.com/articles/526182a) by Regina Nuzzo and how our lab can best combat our own cognitive biases to conduct more robust and ethical science. We addressed "The Texas sharpshooter" cognitive trap, where someone produces multiple results and finds a pattern that may not be accurate. Sometimes a person has a tendency to pick the data that most agrees with their hypothesis or is interesting. A part of the article we thought would be a good way to combat this issue is by having "rivals". In our lab try to create a collaborative environment where we work together to address problems that are related to multiple areas of our research. However, this collaborative environment includes questioning the reasoning of our collaborators and respectively creating counterpoints to address holes in our research results and methods.
