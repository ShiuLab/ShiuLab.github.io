<img src="AmongUs.png" width="350" align="right">We had our lab meeting on a space ship and it turns out that there were imposters among us! (The general concensus was that Shinhan was usually the imposter.)

#### 8/13/20: Outdoor Lab Party

The lab met in Shinhan and Melissa's driveway for an outdoor, socially distanced party. Everyone brought pre-packaged snacks to share. This was the first time the lab had met in person since March!
