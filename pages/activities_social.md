Posters, plenaries, and plenty of protein (both dietary and plant-based). Midwest ASPB gave us fresh ideas and even fresher reasons to keep training our appetites.

We meet at Shinhan and Melissa’s, where the snacks are abundant, the science is lively, and the jokes are peer-reviewed.

#### 8/13/20: Outdoor Lab Party

The lab met in Shinhan and Melissa's driveway for an outdoor, socially distanced party. Everyone brought pre-packaged snacks to share. This was the first time the lab had met in person since March!
