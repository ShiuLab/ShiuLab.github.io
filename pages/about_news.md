#### 2/9/22 Peipei and Fanrui's study on measuring Arabidopsis fitness using Faster R-CNN is accepted

Fitness (number of seeds or fruits producted by an individual) is challenging to measure accurately due to the high fecundity and relatively small propagule sizes.

#### 8/1/21: New grant for the lab
<img src="/images/news/NSF_4-Color_bitmap_Logo.tif" width="100" align="right">In collaboration with two MSU faculty Jiliang Tang and Yuying Xie, Melissa and Shin-Han got an NSF Plant Genome Research Program grant titled [Connecting sequences to functions within and between species through computational modeling and experimental studies](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2107215&HistoricalAwards=false). To have more complete knowledge of how plants work, we will connect DNA sequences with traits they control using an Artificial Intelligence-based approach, machine learning where computers are used to uncover hidden patterns from a wide range of biological data. In addition, we will apply transfer learning to translate knowledge from one plant species to another so we can later transfer what we know about model plants to other species. The outcome of the project will be computer programs that can predict the connections between DNA sequence and traits and transfer information across species. Using these programs, scientists can better understand how plants work and this knowledge can ultimately be used to create more productive and resilient plants.

#### 9/24/19: Sahra and Christina's work on the regulatory mechanisms of cell-type stress response is published

Our story titled [__Cis-regulatory code for predicting plant cell-type transcriptional response to high salinity__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551359) is now published in Plant Physiology with Sahra and Christina as joint first authors. Using the root cell-type transcriptome data, Sahra and Christina identified cis-regulatory sequences likely specify cell-type response to high salinity stress. More importantly, machine learning models were built to ask how well the identified regulatory sequences can predict cell-type response. The findings not only advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the plant spatial transcriptional response, but also suggest broad applicability of the approach to any species, particularly those with little or no trans regulatory data.


#### 9/18/19: Christina's work on benchmarking genomic prediction algorithms is published

This is a collaborative between our colleague Gustavo de los Compos, Chrisitna's internship mentors Andrew McCarren and Mark Roantree, and Emily Bolger a highly productive summer research student. Using data of 18 traits across six plant species with different marker densities and training population sizes, Christina spearheaded a comparison of the performance of six linear and six non-linear algorithms.  The findings highlight that simpler, linear algorithm can beat out more sophiscated machine learning approaches, and the importance of algorithm selection for the prediction of trait values.

#### 8/20/19: John's work on poaceae intergenic transcription is published

John's paper on [__Evolutionary characteristics of intergenic transcribed regions indicate rare novel genes and widespread noisy transcription in the Poaceae__](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431676) is published in Scientific Report. Christina as well as Rosalie Sowers, a highly talented undergrad from Penn State also contribute to this work. Extensive transcriptional activity occurring in intergenic regions of genomes has raised the question whether intergenic transcription represents the activity of novel genes or noisy expression. To assess this, John et al. evaluated cross-species and post-duplication sequence and expression conservation of intergenic transcribed regions. This study provides a framework to identify novel genes using comparative transcriptomic data to improve genome annotation that is fundamental for connecting genotype to phenotype in crop and model systems.
