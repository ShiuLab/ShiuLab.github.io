## What is lab meeting?
Lab meeting is where we meet weekly to talk about individual member research in the lab, lab events, and general lab business. 

## What are the goals of lab meeting? 
### For the presenter:
- Share their research and what they have worked on since their last presentation
- Solicit feedback on research approaches
- Solicit feedback on the overall presentation
### General purposes:
- The audience (other lab members) learn to ask critical questions and provide *_actionable_* feedback
- Discuss "lab business", including fun events we plan to do as a lab, volunteer events, etc.
