<h4 id="72921-siobhans-study-on-modeling-plant-genetic-redundancy-is-published">7/29/21: Siobhan’s study on modeling plant genetic redundancy is published</h4>

<p><img src="/images/news/210729_siobhan_genetic_redundancy.jpg" width="100" align="right" />Genetic redundancy refers to a situation where an individual with a loss-of-function mutation in one gene (single mutant) does not show an apparent phenotype until one or more paralogs are also knocked out (double/higher-order mutant). Siobhan led a study aiming at understanding the factors contributing to genetic redundancy with machine learning approaches. In addition to Siobhan, Peipei, Serena, Beth, Fanrui, and Melissa have contributed significantly to the study. This work is now <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33871641/">published in Molecular Biology &amp; Evolution.</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/news/210417_shinhan_fungal_pathogen.gif" width="100" align="right" />The broad host range of Fusarium virguliforme represents a unique comparative system to identify and define differentially induced responses between an asymptomatic monocot host, maize (Zea mays), and a symptomatic eudicot host, soybean (Glycine max). Led by Amy Baetsen-Young from Brad Day’s lab, Shinhan collaborated on a project examining how asymptomatic and symptomatic hosts respond to F. virguliforme transcriptionally. This work is now <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33681966/">published in Plant Cell</a></p>

<h4 id="92419-sahra-and-christinas-work-on-the-regulatory-mechanisms-of-cell-type-stress-response-is-published">9/24/19: Sahra and Christina’s work on the regulatory mechanisms of cell-type stress response is published</h4>

<p>Our story titled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551359"><strong>Cis-regulatory code for predicting plant cell-type transcriptional response to high salinity</strong></a> is now published in Plant Physiology with Sahra and Christina as joint first authors. Using the root cell-type transcriptome data, Sahra and Christina identified cis-regulatory sequences likely specify cell-type response to high salinity stress. More importantly, machine learning models were built to ask how well the identified regulatory sequences can predict cell-type response. The findings not only advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the plant spatial transcriptional response, but also suggest broad applicability of the approach to any species, particularly those with little or no trans regulatory data.</p>

<h4 id="91819-christinas-work-on-benchmarking-genomic-prediction-algorithms-is-published">9/18/19: Christina’s work on benchmarking genomic prediction algorithms is published</h4>

<p>Chrisitina’s paper on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533955"><strong>Benchmarking Parametric and Machine Learning Models for Genomic Prediction of Complex Traits</strong></a> is published today in G3. This is a collaborative between our colleague Gustavo de los Compos, Chrisitna’s internship mentors Andrew McCarren and Mark Roantree, and Emily Bolger a highly productive summer research student. Using data of 18 traits across six plant species with different marker densities and training population sizes, Christina spearheaded a comparison of the performance of six linear and six non-linear algorithms.  The findings highlight that simpler, linear algorithm can beat out more sophiscated machine learning approaches, and the importance of algorithm selection for the prediction of trait values.</p>

<h4 id="82019-johns-work-on-poaceae-intergenic-transcription-is-published">8/20/19: John’s work on poaceae intergenic transcription is published</h4>

<p>John’s paper on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31431676"><strong>Evolutionary characteristics of intergenic transcribed regions indicate rare novel genes and widespread noisy transcription in the Poaceae</strong></a> is published in Scientific Report. Christina as well as Rosalie Sowers, a highly talented undergrad from Penn State also contribute to this work. Extensive transcriptional activity occurring in intergenic regions of genomes has raised the question whether intergenic transcription represents the activity of novel genes or noisy expression. To assess this, John et al. evaluated cross-species and post-duplication sequence and expression conservation of intergenic transcribed regions. This study provides a framework to identify novel genes using comparative transcriptomic data to improve genome annotation that is fundamental for connecting genotype to phenotype in crop and model systems.</p>
